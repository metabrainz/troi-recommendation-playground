    Generate a playlist using a patch

    patch: the patch to run
    args: the arguments to pass to the patch. in addition to any arguments that the patch takes, the following
     arguments are supported as well:
        debug: Print debug information or not
        args: Other parameters that might need to be passed to the patch [optional]
        print: This option causes the generated playlist to be printed to stdout.
        save: The save option causes the generated playlist to be saved to disk.
        token: Auth token to use when using the LB API. Required for submitting playlists to the server.
               See https://listenbrainz.org/profile to get your user token.
        upload: Whether or not to submit the finished playlist to the LB server. Token must be set for this to work.
        created-for: If this option is specified, it must give a valid user name and the
                     TOKEN argument must specify a user who is whitelisted as a playlist bot at
                     listenbrainz.org .
        name: Override the algorithms that generate a playlist name and use this name instead.
        desc: Override the algorithms that generate a playlist description and use this description instead.
        min-recordings: The minimum number of recordings that must be present in a playlist to consider it complete.
                        If it doesn't have sufficient numbers of tracks, ignore the playlist and don't submit it.
                        Default: Off, a playlist with at least one track will be considere complete.
        spotify: if present, attempt to submit the playlist to spotify as well. should be a dict and contain the
            spotify user id, spotify auth token with appropriate permissions, whether the playlist should be public,
            private or collaborative. it can also optionally have the existing urls to update playlists instead of
            creating new ones.
