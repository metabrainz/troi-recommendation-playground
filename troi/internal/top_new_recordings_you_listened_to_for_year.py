              We generated this playlist from the user's listens and chose all the recordings
              that were released this year and that the user listened to often. We removed recordings
              from duplicate artists so that ideally no artist (or an artist in a collaboration) appears
              more than twice in this playlist, although that may not always be possible. Finally we randomized
              the order of the recordings so that two of the same artists hopefully won't appear in a row.
              </p>
              <p>
              We have attempted to match all of the listens to MusicBrainz
              IDs in order for them to be included in this playlist, but we may not have been able to match them all,
              so some recordings may be missing from this list.
              </p>
              <p>
              This is a review playlist that we hope will give insights the music released during the year.
